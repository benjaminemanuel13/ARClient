# ARClient

This is actually supposed to be the start of an Argumented Reality application for use with AR Headset.

For this reason, the image on the display are split into two panes and are flipped horizonatally.

For the bluetooth joystick project it currently moves the left panes "dot" left and right.

For your project, the MainPage.xaml and MainPage.xaml.cs files under ARClient can be manipulated to do whatever you want to do.

Both Android and UWP are supported (currently, some commented code at line 97 in the BluetoothService needs to be adjusted for UWP)
